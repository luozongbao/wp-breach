    public function resume_scan();
    public function get_results();
}
```

**File:** `includes/scanners/class-wp-breach-core-scanner.php`

```php
class WP_Breach_Core_Scanner implements WP_Breach_Scanner_Interface {
    // Methods:
    // - check_wordpress_version()
    // - verify_core_files()
    // - check_wp_config_security()
    // - scan_core_vulnerabilities()
}
```

#### Plugin Scanner
**File:** `includes/scanners/class-wp-breach-plugin-scanner.php`

```php
class WP_Breach_Plugin_Scanner implements WP_Breach_Scanner_Interface {
    // Methods:
    // - scan_active_plugins()
    // - scan_inactive_plugins()
    // - check_plugin_vulnerabilities()
    // - analyze_plugin_code()
}
```

## Vulnerability Detection Patterns

### 1. SQL Injection Detection
